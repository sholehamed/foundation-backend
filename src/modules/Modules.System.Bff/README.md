# BFF-04 — browser authentication integration (in progress)

> Tracking: [Issue #12](https://github.com/sholehamed/foundation-backend/issues/12).  
> This module **does not yet issue a BFF browser cookie** or expose a login endpoint.

## First security slice

- `Security/BffLocalReturnUrl.cs`: strict same-origin rooted path validation for future `/bff/auth/login?returnUrl=...` and post-login callback routing.
- Accepted: `/`, `/dashboard`, `/dashboard?tab=appointments`.
- Rejected: absolute URLs, protocol-relative paths, backslashes, path traversal, percent-encoded pathname, fragments, CR/LF, overlong input.
- The BFF challenge handler **must** carry the validated result as protected ASP.NET Core OIDC `AuthenticationProperties`; it must never simply reflect an arbitrary request return URL as a Redirect destination.
- This validator is not an authorization check; System/Tenant login and host membership must still be verified by the Identity/BFF middleware.
- Unit tests: `tests/Foundation.Bff.Tests/BffLocalReturnUrlTests.cs`.

## BFF-04 remaining

Confidential OIDC challenge/handshake, authorization-code callback, correlation/nonce, server-held tokens, ticket-backed `__Host-Foundation.Bff` cookie, safe Identity UI continuation and integration E2E. See [ROADMAP](../../../docs/PROJECT-ROADMAP.md) and [PROJECT-STATE](../../../docs/PROJECT-STATE.md).

Current legacy Angular login is untouched, with no automatic migration or token changes.
